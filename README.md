# Flight-Price-Prediction

This is my Mini Project of the Data Science and Big Data Analytics Subject Stream which predicts the price of a flight between two input Indian citites based on the arrival and departure time, date, flying time and other related factors that influence flight's price. I tried many models like Random Forest Regressor, XGBoost, Decision Tree, Gradient Boost, but got best results with Random Forest Regressor. Made a Flask based GUI for this project too.

Results of Random Forest Regressor:
o Training R² Score: 0.9811835605156726
o Testing R² Score: 0.8813855468344876
o Training Accuracy (%): 98.12
o Testing Accuracy (%): 88.14
o MAE (Mean Absolute Error): 564.3439582390064
o RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error): 1673389.772118432
